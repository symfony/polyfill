Please have a look at failing tests, they might be related.

Updated the map 👍 Removed duplicates also in Symfony: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/49159, thanks for pointing this out!

I'm checking the tests. they seem a bit tricky as some characters are being case folded by two chars, which introduces an offset when it comes to `stristr` for instance.
