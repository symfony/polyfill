I've completely changed the function now btw, as it had to return an array and not a boolean as it did before.

Great! Some comments:
- class_uses with a non-existent class name  returns false,
-  we miss a test with a class instance,
- I'm not sure using spl_autoload_register provides more behavior coverage, does it? If yes, then I'd suggest unregistering the autoloader to leave the global state clean after the test has run.

I've fixed the first 2 comments.

The test with `spl_autoload_register` was there to test the second argument of class_uses: `$autoload`. However, I couldn't get things to work probably (unregistering didn't work for me for some reason), so I've removed the tests for now.

:+1: (the missing warning is a bonus to me, nobody should rely on it)

:+1: (if you wanted to add the warning too that would be nice though)

Can we please merge this?
