Thanks for the changes but it doesn't catch the error thrown on `php://temp` because it is not selectable. I'd suggest just relying on the stream_type being `STDIO`:

```php
if ('STDIO' !== $meta['stream_type']) {
    trigger_error('sapi_windows_vt100_support() was not able to analyze the specified stream', E_USER_WARNING);
    return false;
}
```
