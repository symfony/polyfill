@nicolas-grekas I suppose that VarDumper can then be migrated to use the new `spl_object_id` function, right ?

note: merging this PR must wait until the PR is merged in PHP itself. We don't want to merge the polyfill if they reject the PR.

@stof VarDumper can use this polyfill only in master, because of HHVM compat...

The `spl_object_id()` function now merged upstream in https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/5097e2ee13de12b4445b4123e1554c0733c6853c (also see https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/2611#issuecomment-319717081) so this can now be safely merged here, as well.
