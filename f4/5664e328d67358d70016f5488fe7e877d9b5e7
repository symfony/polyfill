So, contrary to what I thought when I created #182 , substr can also return false on newer versions of PHP7. The doc only explain that when $start is EQUAL to string length, PHP5 returned false and PHP7 return empty string. When $start is superior, substr continue to return false.

This is not the way mb_substr works. mb_substr always return an empty string when $start is equal or superior to string length

I added two tests to each encoding that happen to call substr internally (ASCII and CP850).
Every test should fail on PHP5. On PHP7, only the tests with $start longer than the string should fail.

Here is the 3v4l.org link which I used to display my results
https://3v4l.org/QKdXP
(CP850 seems to be missing before PHP5.2.17, but given that this package minimum required version is 5.3.3, I ignored this issue)

I will now begin to modify the mb_substr method to pass the tests

The test are passing.

Please tell me if there is something left to do or if there's something I did wrong. This is one of my first PR so I may have made mistakes.

Thanks
