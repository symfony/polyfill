To you plan to use that in DebugClassLoader? We don't have to, since attributes don't *have* to be instantiated ;)

`DebugClassLoader` should not instantiate the attribute and thus does not need to depend on the polyfill. I thought about adding the polyfill to components where we want to annotate methods with that attribute though.

Either way, providing a polyfill for the attribute and giving app developers the opertunity to `->newInstance()` without shooting themselves in the foot is a good thing, imho. ðŸ™‚
