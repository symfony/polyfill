The APCUIterator polyfill should not be defined in case you skip the loading of other parts of the polyfill due to being in the CLI or phpdbg on Zend Server.

Zend Server doesn't define the APCIterator class, so that code doesn't run.

I'm swamped for a couple weeks.  I can do it after that, or you're welcome to.  Whichever you prefer.

@kategray no pb, I took over :)
I removed the SAPI-related checks because I don't get them.
Should be green and ready.
