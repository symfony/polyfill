We need to bump the dev version to 1.5 (best would be to do it before merging to have the right version in the GH merge commit)

sorry, I didn't follow up on release process here and there is no contributing guidelines. is it responsibility of feature PR to bump version ?

@keradus no. My comment was a reminder for maintainers to bump the version before the merge so that we get the right version (as I may not be the one doing the merge)
