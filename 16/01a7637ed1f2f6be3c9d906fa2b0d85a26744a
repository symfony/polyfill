@nicolas-grekas I‚Äòd like to get to the point that we can actually solve #247. Right now, the nightly run ist just plain dead. :-/

Let's wait for #303.

I've rebased the PR on #303.

Current state of the PR: The tests should run on php 8 with PHPUnit 9.4. ~~They pass on php 7.4 and below and all failures on php 8 should be specific to php 8. I'd suggest to merge it (after #303) to get a proper CI for the PRs that fix PHP 8 compatibility.~~

Forget what I wrote. We should fix that listener.

ü§ûüèª The listener should work now.
